   * This is because the function isn't called by anything!
   *
   * You will need to lookup how to fetch data from an API using React.js
   * Something you might want to look at is the useEffect hook.
   *
   * The useEffect hook will be useful for populating the data in the dropdown box.
   * You will want to make sure that the effect is only called once at component mount.
   *
   * You will also need to explore the use of async/await.
